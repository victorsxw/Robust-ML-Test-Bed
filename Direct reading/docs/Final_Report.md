## Abstract

*(This section should be a concise summary of the entire report, typically 150-250 words. Write this section last, but place it here.)*

The increasing deployment of machine learning (ML) models necessitates rigorous evaluation of their robustness against adversarial attacks. This report details the design, implementation, and testing of the "Robust-ML-Test-Bed," a web-based platform developed to facilitate this evaluation process. The system utilizes a multi-container microservice architecture, orchestrated by Docker Compose, integrating a user-friendly frontend, a Node.js backend for API handling and file management, a Flask backend for executing ML attack simulations (leveraging libraries like TensorFlow Privacy), and a MySQL database for persistent storage. Users can upload their ML models and datasets, configure various attack parameters, execute tests, and visualize the results, culminating in a generated summary report. Key functionalities were validated through systematic testing, demonstrating the platform's capability to serve as a practical tool for researchers and developers assessing ML model resilience. This report covers the system architecture, implementation choices, testing methodology and results, challenges encountered, and potential future enhancements.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Background and Motivation

Machine learning models, particularly deep neural networks, have achieved remarkable success in various domains. However, their susceptibility to adversarial attacks – subtly perturbed inputs designed to cause misclassification – poses significant security risks, especially in critical applications like autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and financial systems. Ensuring the robustness and reliability of these models is paramount. Evaluating model robustness often requires specialized tools and complex setups. This project, Robust-ML-Test-Bed, was motivated by the need for an accessible and integrated platform that allows users to easily test their models against common adversarial attacks without needing deep expertise in attack implementation or environment setup.

### 1.2. Project Goals and Objectives

The primary goal of this project was to design and implement a functional web-based testbed for evaluating the robustness of machine learning models. Specific objectives included:

*   Developing a user-friendly interface for uploading ML models and datasets.
*   Implementing functionality to configure and execute selected adversarial attacks.
*   Integrating backend services to handle file management, task orchestration, and ML computations.
*   Utilizing containerization (Docker) for ease of deployment and environment consistency.
*   Providing clear visualization of test results and metrics.
*   Generating summary reports of the test configurations and outcomes.

## 2. Literature Review

*(This section should provide context by briefly reviewing relevant academic work. Expand this with specific citations based on your research.)*

Adversarial attacks on machine learning models aim to exploit vulnerabilities, causing them to make incorrect predictions with high confidence. Research in this area, pioneered by Szegedy et al. (2013) and Goodfellow et al. (2014) with the introduction of FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method), has rapidly expanded. Attacks can be broadly categorized based on the adversary's knowledge (white-box, black-box, gray-box), the targeted specificity (targeted vs. non-targeted), and the domain (e.g., computer vision, natural language processing).

Common white-box attacks, assuming full knowledge of the model, include gradient-based methods like FGSM, Basic Iterative Method (BIM) / Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) (Madry et al., 2017), and Carlini & Wagner (C&W) attacks (Carlini & Wagner, 2017). Black-box attacks, operating with limited knowledge, often rely on query-based strategies or transferability from substitute models.

Evaluating robustness typically involves measuring model performance (e.g., accuracy) on adversarial examples generated by these attacks. Several libraries and platforms exist to facilitate such evaluations, including CleverHans, Foolbox, and IBM's Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART). Privacy-preserving machine learning techniques, such as those explored by TensorFlow Privacy (used in this project's backend), also intersect with robustness, as methods like differential privacy can sometimes impact model resilience.

This project builds upon these concepts by providing an integrated environment that incorporates elements of model hosting, attack execution (potentially leveraging libraries like TensorFlow Privacy for specific aspects or attacks), and results reporting, aiming for user accessibility.

## 4. Testing & Results Analysis

*(This section summarizes the testing process and key findings, referencing the `Test_Documentation.md` created in Part 2. Fill with actual results.)*

### 4.1. Testing Methodology

System validation followed the plan outlined in `tests/Test_Documentation.md`. The approach primarily involved:

*   **Manual End-to-End Testing:** Simulating user workflows through the web interface, covering file upload, attack configuration, execution, results viewing, and report generation.
*   **Integration Testing:** Verifying communication and data flow between the frontend, Node.js backend, Flask backend, MySQL database, and shared Docker volumes. This included checking API calls, database entries, and file system contents within the Docker environment.
*   **Deployment Testing:** Ensuring the application could be consistently built and started using `docker-compose up --build`.

Key test cases covered functional requirements, basic error handling (e.g., invalid inputs, file type restrictions), and core integration points. *(See `tests/Test_Documentation.md` for the full list of test cases)*.

### 4.2. Key Test Results

*(Present a summary of the actual test outcomes. Use examples.)*

Testing confirmed that the core functionalities of the Robust-ML-Test-Bed were successfully implemented. 

*   **File Upload & Management:** Users were able to successfully upload model and dataset files, which were correctly stored in the designated volumes with the specified naming convention. Validation for file types prevented incorrect uploads.
*   **Attack Execution:** Initiating attacks (e.g., FGSM on a sample model) via the UI correctly triggered the Flask backend processing. The system successfully loaded models/data and executed the attack logic.
*   **Results & Reporting:** Post-attack metrics (e.g., accuracy drop from X% to Y%) were correctly calculated [mention specific metrics] and displayed on the frontend. The report generation feature produced downloadable reports containing the test setup and summary results.
*   **Integration & Deployment:** All services communicated effectively within the Docker network. Database entries correctly reflected the status and outcomes of test runs. The `docker-compose` setup provided a reliable method for building and launching the application.

**Example Result Snapshot:**

| Test Scenario         | Original Accuracy | Attack Type | Epsilon | Accuracy After Attack | Notes                     |
|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------|---------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| MNIST CNN vs FGSM     | 98.5%             | FGSM        | 0.1     | 65.2%                 | Significant drop observed |
| CIFAR-10 ResNet vs PGD | 92.1%             | PGD         | 0.05    | 55.8%                 | PGD proves effective      |

## 5. Problems Encountered and Solutions

*(Discuss challenges faced during the project lifecycle and how they were resolved.)*

Developing the Robust-ML-Test-Bed presented several technical challenges:

*   **Docker Multi-Container Networking & Communication:** Ensuring seamless communication between the Node.js and Flask backend containers within the Docker network required careful configuration in `docker-compose.yml`, including defining explicit service names and potentially managing dependencies (`depends_on`). Initial attempts faced connection issues until the Docker network setup was correctly established.
*   **Dependency Management (Python ML Environment):** Setting up the Python environment within the Flask Docker container, especially with libraries like TensorFlow and potentially GPU support (if applicable), was complex. Conflicts between library versions required careful pinning of dependencies in `requirements.txt` (or equivalent) and potentially adjustments to the `Dockerfile.python`.
*   **Asynchronous Task Handling:** Running potentially long ML attack simulations required implementing an asynchronous task flow. The Node.js backend needed to initiate tasks on the Flask backend without blocking, and a mechanism for tracking status and retrieving results upon completion was necessary [Describe the chosen mechanism - e.g., polling, WebSockets, task queue].
*   **File Handling Across Containers:** Sharing uploaded files stored by the Node.js service with the Flask service necessitated the correct setup and mapping of Docker volumes in `docker-compose.yml`. Permissions issues on the mounted volumes also needed to be addressed by ensuring the user running the application inside the container had appropriate rights.
*   **Integrating Diverse Technologies:** Combining Node.js, Python/Flask, and a web frontend required careful API design and consistent data formats for smooth interaction between the different parts of the system.

These challenges were overcome through iterative development, debugging using Docker logs (`docker logs <container_id>`) and browser developer tools, consulting documentation for Docker, Flask, Node.js, and relevant ML libraries, and careful configuration management.
